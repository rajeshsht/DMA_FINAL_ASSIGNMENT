**MVVM (Model View View Model)**
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups:

* **Models** hold application data. They’re usually structs or simple classes.
* **Views** display visual elements and controls on the screen. They’re typically subclasses of UIView.
* **View models** transform model information into values that can be displayed on a view. They’re usually classes, so they can be passed around as references.

# used Database

SQLite is an open-source relational database i.e. used to perform database operations on android devices such as storing, manipulating or retrieving persistent data from the database.
